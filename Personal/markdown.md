### 4.2 ordered
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
    Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
    If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!
    1. a
    2. b
    3. c
        1. xxx
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
    Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.  
    By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:  
> Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.

4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.  
    Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:
    * Make sure no trout or children are present
    * Use both hands
    * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
